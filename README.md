## Segregation :
The repositry is organised as two seperate directories, one to archieve all the theory-based knowledge gained and the other for the lab work in the workshop. Hence, the division is as follows :
1. [Theory Work](Theory.md)
2. [Lab Work](Labs.md)

## Overview

The workshop's goal is to provide fundamentalÂ knowledge about the ideas behind the Physical Design flow, an important part of the fundamental VLSI flow. Physical Design is broad topic and would require years to come close to mastering. Yet workshop attempts to convey the principles in a concise manner that is just enough to begin working on actual designs. The program is incredibly insightful and intriguing due to the way that concepts are coupled with the practical experience obtained through lab modules. 

This repository serves as an archive of all the knowledge I acquired and encountered during the session. I have utilised several snippets to demonstrate the ideas I gathered in the lectures and the outcomes of my lab module. The "images" branch compiles all of the illustrations used throughout in chronological order. 

I sincerely hope that anybody reading this discovers something new about physical design and is inspired to explore more about the domain.
